# latex-alpine

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/twsldev/latex-alpine)](https://hub.docker.com/r/twsldev/latex-alpine)

A minimalistic LaTeX docker image, based on Alpine and including zip and make as well

## Motivation

This image can be used as a base layer for CI/CD pipelines. I created this Docker image as others were lacking the minimalistic approach.
